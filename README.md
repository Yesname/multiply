# Multiply

This is multiplication table.
Run this stuff on your page:

var someWittyNameOfVariable = new CoreM(a[, b, c, d])

where
a — container node for all the stuff
b — array with some links to the images (you can ignore this since it is deprivated for this time)
c — function in which this stuff will pass an object for saving progress
d — object which have been previously saved

This stuff is saving progress to local storage.
To reset: someWittyNameOfVariable.drop()
